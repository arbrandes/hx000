<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The lab environment consists of two virtual machines, accessible via the
following local IP addresses.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>deploy</em>: <strong><code>192.168.122.100</code></strong></li>
<li><em>alice</em>: <strong><code>192.168.122.111</code></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>deploy</em> node is the only machine with a publicly available IP address.
Your terminal automatically connects to <em>deploy</em>.</p>

<p>When you connect to <em>deploy</em>, you automatically enter a <code>screen</code> session.
<code>screen</code> is a terminal multiplexer that, among other things, allows you
reconnect to a previous session.  This means that if you close the browser page
and return to the exercise later on, your session, including scrollback and
command history, will be exactly as you left it.</p>

<h2>SSH Between Nodes</h2>

<p>You can use SSH from <em>deploy</em> to hop to the other nodes.  To connect to
<em>alice</em>, follow these instructions using the terminal below:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>From the <em>deploy</em> node (it's where you start out), SSH into <em>alice</em> by
entering:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh alice
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>To confirm the authenticity of the host, enter "yes" at the prompt.</p></li>
<li><p>Type the following to return to <code>deploy</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ exit
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Whenever specific instructions are given as the ones above, do your
  best to execute them as stated.  You will be graded on the results.</p>
